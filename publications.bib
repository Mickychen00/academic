abstract = {Energy Return on Investment (EROI) has become a policy analysis tool related to sustainability. However, most EROI studies adopt the standard EROI method, which has two inherent defects. First, standard EROI leaves out energy quality. Second, input factors such as labor, auxiliary services and environmental factors are not considered. Therefore, this paper introduces exergy into the EROI calculation and establishes a new extended exergy-based EROI (ExEROI). ExEROI treats “available energy” as energy quality; with the idea of embodied flows, ExEROI quantifies all the five input factors of the EROI analysis framework. Shale gas exploitation in the Sichuan Basin is used as an example in the case study. The ExEROI result is 9.68, which is much lower than the standard EROI result of 82.95. This is due to the inclusion of more input factors and the fact that the input factors are measured by exergy. Specifically, the auxiliary service input factor accounts for 77.10{\%} of the total inputs, and such inputs are ignored by the standard EROI method. ExEROI makes up for the shortcomings of standard EROI and avoids the possible misinformation caused by standard EROI. ExEROI has the potential for use as an integral aspect of energy resource exploitation evaluations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors.  China's steel industry is an energy-intensive sector. Synergistic reduction of emissions of CO 2 and air pollutants (SO 2 , NOx, and PM2.5) in the steel industry has an important practical significance for climate change and air pollution control. According to the CO 2 emission reduction intensity targets (CERO) and air pollutant emission targets (PERO) for 2020 and 2030, 28 types of energy-saving and emission reduction technologies (20 types of carbon reduction technology and eight types of air pollution end-of-pipe technology) were selected for examination, and a two-stage dynamic optimization model with collaborative implementation of PERO and CERO was built to assess the near future (2015-2020) and long-term (2020-2030) implementation plans for synergistic emissions reduction of CO 2 and air pollutants. The results show that in the near future, the implementation of PERO will have a greater synergistic effect on CO 2 emission reduction. CO 2 emission reduction under PERO in 2020 will be 97 million tons (Mt) higher than that of CERO, an increase of nearly 26{\%}. However, the effects of implementing CERO are better in the long run. Under CERO, the emission reductions of SO 2 , NOx, and PM2.5 in 2030 are 2.44 Mt, 1.47 Mt, and 0.86 Mt, respectively, and 7{\%}, 4{\%}, and 5{\%} higher than the implementation of PERO. As far as marginal abatement cost is concerned, in the near future, the marginal abatement costs of CO 2 and air pollutant equivalents are 1.06 yuan/kgCO 2 and 133 yuan/kg pollution equivalent (pe) under PERO, which are 23{\%} and 11{\%} lower than that of CERO, while in the long run, the marginal abatement costs of CO 2 and pollutant equivalents under CERO are 0.025 yuan/kgCO 2 and 2.73 yuan/kgpe, about 96{\%} and 95{\%} lower than that of PERO.},

@article{Huang2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd Effective policy requires comprehensive analysis of many factors. But presently there does not exist a sufficiently comprehensive research on the interrelationship between energy input and output, carbon emissions, and water use in the oil and gas extraction process. To more comprehensively measure this phenomenon, this paper constructs an assessment model of energy return on energy, carbon, and water investment for the development of oil and gas resources using the Daqing and Shengli oilfields as practical examples. The results show that the method for evaluating energy input and output (energy return on energy invested) can be made more comprehensive for covering the resources required in the oilfield extraction process; this method ignores the environmental impacts of carbon emissions (energy return on carbon) and water use (energy return on water). However, the energy return evaluation method, which considers energy, carbon, and water inputs, is more comprehensive and practically used to evaluate the development status of oil and gas resources as well as other types of energy development processes. Policy implications for biophysical input accounting and the management of energy resource extraction are given accordingly.},

@article{Guo2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. Carbon utilization and storage (CCUS) project represented by enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology provides a feasible way for the CCS dynamic cost to decline. With the development of CCS and the cost reduction of power plant capture, the possibility of oil companies receiving CO2 from power plants will increase, which makes CO2 and oil resources more fully utilized. Based on this fact, this work proposes a novel model regarding the CCS–EOR project to systematically evaluate the CCS development path and the EOR utilization process. By considering the CO2 source captured by CCS and the utilization process of EOR process, the cost-benefit model of integrated system is established, and the CO2 capture/injection path of CCS/EOR is optimized. This model helps to analyze CCS investment and carbon capture process from the perspective of the whole project process, and provides a feasible reference for practical large-scale engineering decision-making project.},

@article{Guo2020a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd In the medium to long term, China must conduct deep emission reduction actions to transform the country's economy and meet the conditions of the Paris Agreement. As an advanced emission reduction technology, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is undoubtedly an important means of achieving this goal. China must consider how to retrofit existing thermal power plants to install CCS technology. Thus, the expected future roadmap for power plants with CO2 capture is of significant interest. To achieve this aim, we propose a new CCS project investment model, which helps design the CCS development roadmap for achieving the emission targets for 2050. Reductions in the cost of technologies as a result of learning-by-doing is considered to enrich the model to describe the reality more sensibly. Through some mathematical skills, we transform the original continuous problem into a nonlinear integer programming problem. By solving the model, we are trying to answer questions about when to adopt CCS technology and the cost. The results reveal that early large-scale CCS demonstrations are not necessary. The peak investment period of CCS is around 2035. Operating costs account for 80{\%} of the overall cost of CCS, and thus, policymakers must fully motivate the development and investment of operating technologies, especially capture technologies. The results also show that when the scale of CCS technology is promoted, flexible installation levels can be considered to improve efficiency and reduce costs.},
