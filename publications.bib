abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 by the authors. China's steel industry is an energy-intensive sector. Synergistic reduction of emissions of CO 2 and air pollutants (SO 2 , NOx, and PM2.5) in the steel industry has an important practical significance for climate change and air pollution control. According to the CO 2 emission reduction intensity targets (CERO) and air pollutant emission targets (PERO) for 2020 and 2030, 28 types of energy-saving and emission reduction technologies (20 types of carbon reduction technology and eight types of air pollution end-of-pipe technology) were selected for examination, and a two-stage dynamic optimization model with collaborative implementation of PERO and CERO was built to assess the near future (2015-2020) and long-term (2020-2030) implementation plans for synergistic emissions reduction of CO 2 and air pollutants. The results show that in the near future, the implementation of PERO will have a greater synergistic effect on CO 2 emission reduction. CO 2 emission reduction under PERO in 2020 will be 97 million tons (Mt) higher than that of CERO, an increase of nearly 26{\%}. However, the effects of implementing CERO are better in the long run. Under CERO, the emission reductions of SO 2 , NOx, and PM2.5 in 2030 are 2.44 Mt, 1.47 Mt, and 0.86 Mt, respectively, and 7{\%}, 4{\%}, and 5{\%} higher than the implementation of PERO. As far as marginal abatement cost is concerned, in the near future, the marginal abatement costs of CO 2 and air pollutant equivalents are 1.06 yuan/kgCO 2 and 133 yuan/kg pollution equivalent (pe) under PERO, which are 23{\%} and 11{\%} lower than that of CERO, while in the long run, the marginal abatement costs of CO 2 and pollutant equivalents under CERO are 0.025 yuan/kgCO 2 and 2.73 yuan/kgpe, about 96{\%} and 95{\%} lower than that of PERO.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd Effective policy requires comprehensive analysis of many factors. But presently there does not exist a sufficiently comprehensive research on the interrelationship between energy input and output, carbon emissions, and water use in the oil and gas extraction process. To more comprehensively measure this phenomenon, this paper constructs an assessment model of energy return on energy, carbon, and water investment for the development of oil and gas resources using the Daqing and Shengli oilfields as practical examples. The results show that the method for evaluating energy input and output (energy return on energy invested) can be made more comprehensive for covering the resources required in the oilfield extraction process; this method ignores the environmental impacts of carbon emissions (energy return on carbon) and water use (energy return on water). However, the energy return evaluation method, which considers energy, carbon, and water inputs, is more comprehensive and practically used to evaluate the development status of oil and gas resources as well as other types of energy development processes. Policy implications for biophysical input accounting and the management of energy resource extraction are given accordingly.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier B.V. Carbon utilization and storage (CCUS) project represented by enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology provides a feasible way for the CCS dynamic cost to decline. With the development of CCS and the cost reduction of power plant capture, the possibility of oil companies receiving CO2 from power plants will increase, which makes CO2 and oil resources more fully utilized. Based on this fact, this work proposes a novel model regarding the CCS–EOR project to systematically evaluate the CCS development path and the EOR utilization process. By considering the CO2 source captured by CCS and the utilization process of EOR process, the cost-benefit model of integrated system is established, and the CO2 capture/injection path of CCS/EOR is optimized. This model helps to analyze CCS investment and carbon capture process from the perspective of the whole project process, and provides a feasible reference for practical large-scale engineering decision-making project.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Elsevier Ltd In the medium to long term, China must conduct deep emission reduction actions to transform the country's economy and meet the conditions of the Paris Agreement. As an advanced emission reduction technology, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is undoubtedly an important means of achieving this goal. China must consider how to retrofit existing thermal power plants to install CCS technology. Thus, the expected future roadmap for power plants with CO2 capture is of significant interest. To achieve this aim, we propose a new CCS project investment model, which helps design the CCS development roadmap for achieving the emission targets for 2050. Reductions in the cost of technologies as a result of learning-by-doing is considered to enrich the model to describe the reality more sensibly. Through some mathematical skills, we transform the original continuous problem into a nonlinear integer programming problem. By solving the model, we are trying to answer questions about when to adopt CCS technology and the cost. The results reveal that early large-scale CCS demonstrations are not necessary. The peak investment period of CCS is around 2035. Operating costs account for 80{\%} of the overall cost of CCS, and thus, policymakers must fully motivate the development and investment of operating technologies, especially capture technologies. The results also show that when the scale of CCS technology is promoted, flexible installation levels can be considered to improve efficiency and reduce costs.},

abstract = {Energy Return on Investment (EROI) has become a policy analysis tool related to sustainability. However, most EROI studies adopt the standard EROI method, which has two inherent defects. First, standard EROI leaves out energy quality. Second, input factors such as labor, auxiliary services and environmental factors are not considered. Therefore, this paper introduces exergy into the EROI calculation and establishes a new extended exergy-based EROI (ExEROI). ExEROI treats “available energy” as energy quality; with the idea of embodied flows, ExEROI quantifies all the five input factors of the EROI analysis framework. Shale gas exploitation in the Sichuan Basin is used as an example in the case study. The ExEROI result is 9.68, which is much lower than the standard EROI result of 82.95. This is due to the inclusion of more input factors and the fact that the input factors are measured by exergy. Specifically, the auxiliary service input factor accounts for 77.10{\%} of the total inputs, and such inputs are ignored by the standard EROI method. ExEROI makes up for the shortcomings of standard EROI and avoids the possible misinformation caused by standard EROI. ExEROI has the potential for use as an integral aspect of energy resource exploitation evaluations.},

abstract = {As one of the essential sub-industry of the energy industry, the oil{\&} gas extraction industry contributes oil{\&} gas resources for our social-economic system. Meanwhile, it consumes energy inputs as the investment in energy resources exploitation, emits greenhouse gases(GHG), and consumes water resources. There is still a lack of systematic research on energy input, carbon emissions and water consumption of oil and gas extraction industry. To accurately measure the exploitation status and concomitant environmental impacts of the oil{\&} gas extraction industry, the present study, from a perspective of huge oilfields, applies the theory of industrial metabolism from industrial ecology research field to investigate the energy, carbon and water metabolism of oil{\&} gas extraction industry. This paper builds a comprehensive assessment model for energy, carbon, and water metabolism in oil{\&} gas industry and applies it to research objects such as Daqing and Shengli oilfields. The results show that from the perspective of energy metabolism, for Daqing, Shengli, Liaohe oilfields, their EROIs are all declining and the future net energy outputs of them will significantly drop; the EROIs of Xinjiang and Shaanxi provinces'oil{\&} gas extraction display rising trends. The EROIs of the imported oil{\&} gas are generally higher than domestic oilfields. The accounting results of carbon metabolism show that the carbon emissions of Daqing and Shengli oilfields are declining. The EROC of Daqing is basically higher than Shengli. The water metabolism results show that, for Daqing's industrial water use and freshwater use, both rise originally and then decline; The industrial and freshwater consumptions of Shengli oilfield are both falling. The direct water consumptions of Shengli and Daqing are rising. The EROWFresh of Shengli is generally higher than Daqing. However, the EROWTotal of Shengli almost equals to Daqing. Within the research field, for Shengli and Daqing oilfields, the EROIs is generally backsliding. However, the EROC and EROWFresh are rising; both of them needs more energy inputs, fewer carbon emissions, and fewer freshwater consumptions to produce one unit energy outputs. To slow down the downward trend of net energy output of Shengli and Daqing, and simultaneously, to continually alleviate the environmental impacts of oil{\&} gas production process, we need the oil{\&} gas industry to reduce energy, carbon, and water uses intensities unceasingly by using multiple methods. The oilfields ought to mitigate direct energy inputs, carbon emissions, and water consumptions.},

ABSTRACT = {Climate change has become a global concern, and the development of a green economy has attracted wide attention. Understanding the driving factors and growth potential of provincial-level carbon productivity is crucial for China’s green economic development in the new normal phase. In this study, the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) is adopted to systematically investigate the driving factors of provincial carbon productivity and explore the growth potential of provinces’ carbon productivity based on the clustering analysis. The results show that: (1) China’s provincial carbon productivity presents an increasing trend in 2001–2017, but the differences in carbon productivity among provinces are widening. (2) Economic activity and industrial structure are key to push up regional carbon productivity in China, while energy intensity is the main factor pulling it down. (3) The potential for carbon productivity improvement varies greatly among provinces in the four groups. Specifically, in groups 1 and 2, the developed provinces have little potential for improving carbon productivity, while the developing provinces in group 4 are just the opposite. These findings can enlighten policymakers that the development of a green economy should focus on optimizing and upgrading industrial structure and reducing energy intensity, and provincial heterogeneity must be considered when formulating green economic development policies.},
