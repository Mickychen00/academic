However, most EROI studies adopt the standard EROI method, which has two inherent defects. First, standard EROI leaves out energy quality. Second, input factors such as labor, auxiliary services and environmental factors are not considered. Therefore, this paper introduces exergy into the EROI calculation and establishes a new extended exergy-based EROI (ExEROI). ExEROI treats “available energy” as energy quality; with the idea of embodied flows, ExEROI quantifies all the five input factors of the EROI analysis framework. Shale gas exploitation in the Sichuan Basin is used as an example in the case study. The ExEROI result is 9.68, which is much lower than the standard EROI result of 82.95. This is due to the inclusion of more input factors and the fact that the input factors are measured by exergy. Specifically, the auxiliary service input factor accounts for 77.10% of the total inputs, and such inputs are ignored by the standard EROI method. ExEROI makes up for the shortcomings of standard EROI and avoids the possible misinformation caused by standard EROI. ExEROI has the potential for use as an integral aspect of energy resource exploitation evaluations.","tags":["Energy return on investment","Extended-exergy","Shale gas extraction"],"title":"Extended-exergy based energy return on investment method and its application to shale gas extraction in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.-X.

As an advanced emission reduction technology, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is undoubtedly an important means of achieving this goal. China must consider how to retrofit existing thermal power plants to install CCS technology. Thus, the expected future roadmap for power plants with CO2 capture is of significant interest. To achieve this aim, we propose a new CCS project investment model, which helps design the CCS development roadmap for achieving the emission targets for 2050. Reductions in the cost of technologies as a result of learning-by-doing is considered to enrich the model to describe the reality more sensibly. Through some mathematical skills, we transform the original continuous problem into a nonlinear integer programming problem. By solving the model, we are trying to answer questions about when to adopt CCS technology and the cost. The results reveal that early large-scale CCS demonstrations are not necessary. The peak investment period of CCS is around 2035. Operating costs account for 80% of the overall cost of CCS, and thus, policymakers must fully motivate the development and investment of operating technologies, especially capture technologies. The results also show that when the scale of CCS technology is promoted, flexible installation levels can be considered to improve efficiency and reduce costs.","tags":["Abatement strategy","CCS development roadmap","Learning by doing","Nonlinear integer programming"],"title":"Feasible roadmap for CCS retrofit of coal-based power plants to reduce Chinese carbon emissions by 2050","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.-X.

Carbon utilization and storage (CCUS) project represented by enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology provides a feasible way for the CCS dynamic cost to decline.

By considering the CO2 source captured by CCS and the utilization process of EOR process, the cost-benefit model of integrated system is established, and the CO2 capture/injection path of CCS/EOR is optimized.

China's steel industry is an energy-intensive sector. Synergistic reduction of emissions of CO 2 and air pollutants (SO 2 , NOx, and PM2.5) in the steel industry has an important practical significance for climate change and air pollution control. According to the CO 2 emission reduction intensity targets (CERO) and air pollutant emission targets (PERO) for 2020 and 2030, 28 types of energy-saving and emission reduction technologies (20 types of carbon reduction technology and eight types of air pollution end-of-pipe technology) were selected for examination, and a two-stage dynamic optimization model with collaborative implementation of PERO and CERO was built to assess the near future (2015-2020) and long-term (2020-2030) implementation plans for synergistic emissions reduction of CO 2 and air pollutants. The results show that in the near future, the implementation of PERO will have a greater synergistic effect on CO 2 emission reduction. CO 2 emission reduction under PERO in 2020 will be 97 million tons (Mt) higher than that of CERO, an increase of nearly 26%. However, the effects of implementing CERO are better in the long run. Under CERO, the emission reductions of SO 2 , NOx, and PM2.5 in 2030 are 2.44 Mt, 1.47 Mt, and 0.86 Mt, respectively, and 7%, 4%, and 5% higher than the implementation of PERO. As far as marginal abatement cost is concerned, in the near future, the marginal abatement costs of CO 2 and air pollutant equivalents are 1.06 yuan/kgCO 2 and 133 yuan/kg pollution equivalent (pe) under PERO, which are 23% and 11% lower than that of CERO, while in the long run, the marginal abatement costs of CO 2 and pollutant equivalents under CERO are 0.025 yuan/kgCO 2 and 2.73 yuan/kgpe, about 96% and 95% lower than that of PERO.","tags":["Air pollution treatment","CO   emission reduction  2","Steel industry","Synergistic emission reduction"],"title":"Study on an implementation scheme of synergistic emission reduction of CO2 and air pollutants in China's steel industry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huang Chen","Xu Yinghua","Feng Lianyong","Chen Yingchao","Wang Ke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4d2656f21ec285dae5d97fbaad6abb54","permalink":"/publication/chen-2018/","publishdate":"2020-06-04T08:08:12.138748Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"By using Derwent Innovation Patent Database and an improved DWPI manual code classification,we applied the methods of patent distribution structure,patent application trends and future patent development forecast to analyze the oil gas industry's patents.

Meanwhile, it consumes energy inputs as the investment in energy resources exploitation, emits greenhouse gases(GHG), and consumes water resources. There is still a lack of systematic research on energy input, carbon emissions and water consumption of oil and gas extraction industry. To accurately measure the exploitation status and concomitant environmental impacts of the oil\u0026 gas extraction industry, the present study, from a perspective of huge oilfields, applies the theory of industrial metabolism from industrial ecology research field to investigate the energy, carbon and water metabolism of oil\u0026 gas extraction industry. This paper builds a comprehensive assessment model for energy, carbon, and water metabolism in oil\u0026 gas industry and applies it to research objects such as Daqing and Shengli oilfields. The results show that from the perspective of energy metabolism, for Daqing, Shengli, Liaohe oilfields, their EROIs are all declining and the future net energy outputs of them will significantly drop; the EROIs of Xinjiang and Shaanxi provinces'oil\u0026 gas extraction display rising trends. The EROIs of the imported oil\u0026 gas are generally higher than domestic oilfields. The accounting results of carbon metabolism show that the carbon emissions of Daqing and Shengli oilfields are declining. The EROC of Daqing is basically higher than Shengli. The water metabolism results show that, for Daqing's industrial water use and freshwater use, both rise originally and then decline; The industrial and freshwater consumptions of Shengli oilfield are both falling. The direct water consumptions of Shengli and Daqing are rising. The EROWFresh of Shengli is generally higher than Daqing. However, the EROWTotal of Shengli almost equals to Daqing. Within the research field, for Shengli and Daqing oilfields, the EROIs is generally backsliding. However, the EROC and EROWFresh are rising; both of them needs more energy inputs, fewer carbon emissions, and fewer freshwater consumptions to produce one unit energy outputs. To slow down the downward trend of net energy output of Shengli and Daqing, and simultaneously, to continually alleviate the environmental impacts of oil\u0026 gas production process, we need the oil\u0026 gas industry to reduce energy, carbon, and water uses intensities unceasingly by using multiple methods. The oilfields ought to mitigate direct energy inputs, carbon emissions, and water consumptions.","tags":null,"title":"Research on the metabolism of oil\u0026 gas extraction industry: from the perspective of huge oilfields (In Chinese)","type":"publication"}]
