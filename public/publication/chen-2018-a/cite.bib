 abstract = {As one of the essential sub-industry of the energy industry, the oil& gas extraction industry contributes oil& gas resources for our social-economic system. Meanwhile, it consumes energy inputs as the investment in energy resources exploitation, emits greenhouse gases(GHG), and consumes water resources. There is still a lack of systematic research on energy input, carbon emissions and water consumption of oil and gas extraction industry. To accurately measure the exploitation status and concomitant environmental impacts of the oil& gas extraction industry, the present study, from a perspective of huge oilfields, applies the theory of industrial metabolism from industrial ecology research field to investigate the energy, carbon and water metabolism of oil& gas extraction industry. This paper builds a comprehensive assessment model for energy, carbon, and water metabolism in oil& gas industry and applies it to research objects such as Daqing and Shengli oilfields. The results show that from the perspective of energy metabolism, for Daqing, Shengli, Liaohe oilfields, their EROIs are all declining and the future net energy outputs of them will significantly drop; the EROIs of Xinjiang and Shaanxi provinces'oil& gas extraction display rising trends. The EROIs of the imported oil& gas are generally higher than domestic oilfields. The accounting results of carbon metabolism show that the carbon emissions of Daqing and Shengli oilfields are declining. The EROC of Daqing is basically higher than Shengli. The water metabolism results show that, for Daqing's industrial water use and freshwater use, both rise originally and then decline; The industrial and freshwater consumptions of Shengli oilfield are both falling. The direct water consumptions of Shengli and Daqing are rising. The EROWFresh of Shengli is generally higher than Daqing. However, the EROWTotal of Shengli almost equals to Daqing. Within the research field, for Shengli and Daqing oilfields, the EROIs is generally backsliding. However, the EROC and EROWFresh are rising; both of them needs more energy inputs, fewer carbon emissions, and fewer freshwater consumptions to produce one unit energy outputs. To slow down the downward trend of net energy output of Shengli and Daqing, and simultaneously, to continually alleviate the environmental impacts of oil& gas production process, we need the oil& gas industry to reduce energy, carbon, and water uses intensities unceasingly by using multiple methods. The oilfields ought to mitigate direct energy inputs, carbon emissions, and water consumptions.},
