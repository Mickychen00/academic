abstract: "© 2019 Elsevier B.V. Carbon utilization and storage (CCUS) project represented by enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology provides a feasible way for the CCS dynamic cost to decline. With the development of CCS and the cost reduction of power plant capture, the possibility of oil companies receiving CO2 from power plants will increase, which makes CO2 and oil resources more fully utilized. Based on this fact, this work proposes a novel model regarding the CCS–EOR project to systematically evaluate the CCS development path and the EOR utilization process. By considering the CO2 source captured by CCS and the utilization process of EOR process, the cost-benefit model of integrated system is established, and the CO2 capture/injection path of CCS/EOR is optimized. This model helps to analyze CCS investment and carbon capture process from the perspective of the whole project process, and provides a feasible reference for practical large-scale engineering decision-making project."
