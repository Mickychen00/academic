abstract: "The energy infrastructure has emitted massive GHGs and will suffer greatly\
  \ from climate risks. Given China's largest installed capacity globally, assessing\
  \ climate impacts on diverse power infrastructures will yield critical risk information\
  \ and support climate-resilient policymaking. However, lacking detailed plant-level\
  \ data and ignoring the integrated infrastructural management of adaptation and\
  \ mitigation priorly impede an in-depth evaluation. By employing high-coverage and\
  \ -resolution plant-level data and the outputs of six CMIP6 models, we evaluate\
  \ the pending climate impacts on five power-production sources at the interprovincial\
  \ and plant levels in China. We find a pervasive negative impact on China's power\
  \ sector, and the adverse effects expand over time (short-term: 214–342 TWh, long-term:\
  \ 268–397 TWh, 25–75% quantile). For different future scenarios, the greater the\
  \ radiative forcing, the greater the loss of power generation. Fossil-related production\
  \ loss will completely offset the gain in most provinces from renewable power, with\
  \ an overall negative impact in these regions. Besides, two evident phenomena occur:\
  \ First, spatial heterogeneity appears across diverse provinces; second, a critical\
  \ minority of China's plants with a low capacity share contribute to the main body\
  \ of climate impacts. We consider the need for a targeted coal decommissioning strategy\
  \ for climate adaptation."
