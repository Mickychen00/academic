abstract: "There is a significant uncertainty in the future global greenhouse gas emission path, and there may be significant difficulties in achieving the temperature control target of 1.5℃ or even 2℃ globally. The uncertainty of mitigation actions and the final mitigation effects makes it more urgent to accelerate the adaptation process. Therefore, in the context that insufficient global in-depth emission reductions has led to intensified future climate change risks, strengthening climate change adaptation actions has become necessary for countries to respond to climate risks and improve climate resilience. Unlike the relatively straight forward characteristics of the critical objects, influencing factors, and consideration indicators in the field of mitigation, the focal issues in adaptation to climate change still need to be scientifically identified by academic and policy communities. At the global level, countries with different development levels are carrying out adaptation actions with different strengths. Identifying the characteristics of their adaptation actions will help summarize the global experience of climate adaptation governance. The country-specific comparative research on international climate adaptation governance has significant research and practical value in the current lack of a unified academic and policy consensus. Although the United States has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, most developed countries are still actively participating in global climate governance. The United Kingdom and Germany are typical representatives. As the largest developing country and greenhouse gas emitter, China also plays an essential role in global governance. 
This study analyzes and compares the evolution of climate change adaptation strategies and the characteristics of governance systems in China, the United Kingdom and Germany. We found that different countries have different goals for domestic adaptation progress and international climate adaptation governance. For example, the UK pays more attention to become a future climate adaptation financial center, and Germany pays more attention to becoming a global adaptation technology standard setter. Although China′s climate action in the past decade has gradually accelerated its adaptation process and made some progress, there is still a clear gap between China and the UK, and Germany in climate adaptation governance. It can reflect in the fields such as the top-level design and governance system, capacity building, finance supply, technical system, international layout. 
Besides, based on the adaptation knowledge, technology, and finance gaps pointed out in the Global Adaptation Gap Report, we conducted a three-dimensional inspection of China, Britain, and Germany, and proposed several policy recommendations to improve China′s climate adaptation governance from the three capabilities of adaptation knowledge, technology, and finance based on the lessons learned. We aim to provide a decision-making reference for China to strive for the initiative in a new round of international climate game and enhance its global climate governance leadership."
