abstract: "By using Derwent Innovation Patent Database and an improved DWPI manual code classification,we applied the methods of patent distribution structure,patent application trends and future patent development forecast to analyze the oil gas industry's patents. In recent years,owing to the industry's main business income decline,the number of annual patent applications shows a downward trend in oil gas exploration and mining industry,as well as in oil gas refining industry. With the rapid development of domestic storage and transportation business,the development trend of oil gas storage and transportation industry patents is promising."
