abstract: "Â© 2019 by the authors.  China's steel industry is an energy-intensive sector. Synergistic reduction of emissions of CO 2 and air pollutants (SO 2 , NOx, and PM2.5) in the steel industry has an important practical significance for climate change and air pollution control. According to the CO 2 emission reduction intensity targets (CERO) and air pollutant emission targets (PERO) for 2020 and 2030, 28 types of energy-saving and emission reduction technologies (20 types of carbon reduction technology and eight types of air pollution end-of-pipe technology) were selected for examination, and a two-stage dynamic optimization model with collaborative implementation of PERO and CERO was built to assess the near future (2015-2020) and long-term (2020-2030) implementation plans for synergistic emissions reduction of CO 2 and air pollutants. The results show that in the near future, the implementation of PERO will have a greater synergistic effect on CO 2 emission reduction. CO 2 emission reduction under PERO in 2020 will be 97 million tons (Mt) higher than that of CERO, an increase of nearly 26%. However, the effects of implementing CERO are better in the long run. Under CERO, the emission reductions of SO 2 , NOx, and PM2.5 in 2030 are 2.44 Mt, 1.47 Mt, and 0.86 Mt, respectively, and 7%, 4%, and 5% higher than the implementation of PERO. As far as marginal abatement cost is concerned, in the near future, the marginal abatement costs of CO 2 and air pollutant equivalents are 1.06 yuan/kgCO 2 and 133 yuan/kg pollution equivalent (pe) under PERO, which are 23% and 11% lower than that of CERO, while in the long run, the marginal abatement costs of CO 2 and pollutant equivalents under CERO are 0.025 yuan/kgCO 2 and 2.73 yuan/kgpe, about 96% and 95% lower than that of PERO."
