abstract: The cement industry, which contributes to 8 % of global CO2 emissions and
  a large quantity of air pollutants, plays a pivotal role in achieving the carbon
  neutrality target. However, the question of how to decarbonize the cement industry
  toward net-zero emissions and the corresponding environmental impact remains unclear.
  An integrated assessment framework combining a top-down computable general equilibrium
  model, a bottom-up technology selection model, and a life-cycle assessment was developed
  to explore the cement industry’s carbon–neutral pathways and associated environmental
  impact. Results show that promoting energy-efficient technologies is crucial for
  reducing CO2 emissions in the short term, which can also significantly reduce air
  pollutant emissions. Improving energy efficiency contributes to reducing the emissions
  of SO2, NOx, and PM2.5, by 33 %, 35 %, and 8 %, respectively, by 2030. In the long
  run, achieving net-zero carbon emissions requires implementation of bioenergy with
  carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and demand-side mitigation measures. The share
  of kilns equipped with BECCS would increase to 68–75 % by 2060. Corresponding unit
  abatement costs of CO2 are 484–676 CNY/tonne CO2. However, BECCS triggers adverse
  side effects by increasing water consumption and land cover by 7–11 km3 and 3–4
  Mha, respectively, in 2060. Thus, China should take full advantage of energy-efficient
  technologies to co-control CO2 and air pollutant emissions while avoiding negative
  effects of BECCS.
