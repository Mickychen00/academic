abstract: 'Climate change has become a global concern, and the development of a green
  economy has attracted wide attention. Understanding the driving factors and growth
  potential of provincial-level carbon productivity is crucial for China’s green economic
  development in the new normal phase. In this study, the logarithmic mean Divisia
  index (LMDI) is adopted to systematically investigate the driving factors of provincial
  carbon productivity and explore the growth potential of provinces’ carbon productivity
  based on the clustering analysis. The results show that: (1) China’s provincial
  carbon productivity presents an increasing trend in 2001–2017, but the differences
  in carbon productivity among provinces are widening. (2) Economic activity and industrial
  structure are key to push up regional carbon productivity in China, while energy
  intensity is the main factor pulling it down. (3) The potential for carbon productivity
  improvement varies greatly among provinces in the four groups. Specifically, in
  groups 1 and 2, the developed provinces have little potential for improving carbon
  productivity, while the developing provinces in group 4 are just the opposite. These
  findings can enlighten policymakers that the development of a green economy should
  focus on optimizing and upgrading industrial structure and reducing energy intensity,
  and provincial heterogeneity must be considered when formulating green economic
  development policies.'
